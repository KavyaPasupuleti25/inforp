Widget SDK v3.3.0-rc.2 has now been released. It's built from Homepages v12.0.46, which is the release for Infor OS 2021-03. Changes in this version include:

* Added support for lower and upper pipe in URL templates. Example for helpUrl with variable Language needed in lowercase.
* Added support in the homepages pack script to pack a standard widget as a tenant widget, using the --asTenant flag.
* Updated to Angular 11.0.7.
* Updated to IDS Enterprise 4.36.1.
* Updated to IDS Enterprise NG 9.1.1.

You'll find the release details and the downloadable zip [here](https://github.com/infor-cloud/homepages-widget-sdk/releases/tag/v3.3.0-rc.2)

The new pack script update will help you deploy & test a widget in an Infor OS Cloud environment a lot easier than before, since it can be packed as a tenant widget without having to modify the actual source code.
